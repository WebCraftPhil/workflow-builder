# Workflow Builder

## Description

A sophisticated multi-agent workflow orchestration system designed to automate complex business processes through intelligent agent coordination. The system enables the creation, execution, and monitoring of workflows that involve multiple autonomous agents working together to accomplish specific objectives.

**Key Features:**

- Autonomous agent management and coordination
- Flexible workflow orchestration engine
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Real-time monitoring and logging
- Scalable architecture for enterprise deployment

TODO: Expand with specific use cases, target audience, and competitive advantages.

## Architecture Summary

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Agent Layer**: Individual autonomous agents with specialized capabilities
- **Orchestration Layer**: Workflow engine that coordinates agent activities
- **Communication Layer**: Message passing and API integration infrastructure
- **Persistence Layer**: Data storage and state management
- **Monitoring Layer**: Observability and performance tracking

### Core Components

- **Agents**: Specialized software components that perform specific tasks
- **Workflow Engine**: Central coordinator that manages execution flow
- **Message Broker**: Handles inter-agent communication
- **Configuration System**: Manages agent and workflow settings
- **API Gateway**: Provides external access to system functionality

TODO: Add architecture diagrams and detailed component descriptions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16.0 or higher)
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment)
- **Kubernetes** (for production orchestration)
- **PostgreSQL** (for data persistence)
- **Redis** (for caching and message queuing)

### System Requirements

- **Minimum**: 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, 50GB storage
- **Recommended**: 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage
- **Production**: Scale based on workload requirements

TODO: Add specific version requirements and compatibility matrix.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/workflow-builder.git
cd workflow-builder

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your specific configuration
```

#### 2. Database Setup

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL and Redis (via Docker)
docker-compose up -d postgres redis

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate
```

#### 3. Agent Configuration

```bash
# Configure agents (see agents.md for details)
npm run configure-agents

# Start the workflow engine
npm run start:engine
```

#### 4. Verification

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Run sample workflow
npm run example:workflow
```

TODO: Add detailed setup scripts and verification procedures.
