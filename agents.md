# Agents Documentation

## Overview

This document defines the autonomous agents used in the workflow system. Agents are specialized software components that perform specific tasks, make decisions, and interact with each other to accomplish complex workflows.

TODO: Expand with system-wide agent architecture and design principles.

## Agent Types

### Agent Name 1
**Role:** [Brief description of the agent's primary responsibility]

**Capabilities:**
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]

**Dependencies:** [External services or APIs this agent relies on]

### Agent Name 2
**Role:** [Brief description of the agent's primary responsibility]

**Capabilities:**
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]

**Dependencies:** [External services or APIs this agent relies on]

### Agent Name 3
**Role:** [Brief description of the agent's primary responsibility]

**Capabilities:**
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]
- [Capability 3]

**Dependencies:** [External services or APIs this agent relies on]

TODO: Add more agent types as the system grows. Consider adding diagrams showing agent relationships.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `AGENT_1_API_KEY`: Required API key for Agent 1 external service
- `AGENT_2_ENDPOINT`: Base URL for Agent 2 service endpoint
- `AGENT_TIMEOUT`: Global timeout setting for agent operations (default: 30s)

### Configuration Files
- `agents/config.yaml`: Main agent configuration file
- `agents/policies.json`: Agent behavior and decision-making policies

TODO: Define specific configuration schemas and validation requirements.

## Communication

### Inter-Agent Communication
Agents communicate through:
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous message passing via [queue system]
- **Direct API Calls**: Synchronous request-response between agents
- **Event Broadcasting**: Publish-subscribe pattern for state changes

### External API Integration
- **REST APIs**: Standard HTTP-based communication with external services
- **Webhooks**: Incoming notifications from external systems
- **Database Integration**: Shared data persistence layer

### Communication Protocols
- **Message Format**: JSON-based structured data exchange
- **Authentication**: API keys and JWT tokens for secure communication
- **Rate Limiting**: Request throttling to prevent system overload

TODO: Define specific message schemas, error handling, and communication patterns.
